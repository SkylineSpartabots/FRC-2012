## Metadata
This is the code needed to operate the robot for the FIRST Robotics
Competition (FRC).  Specifically, it's made for the 2011-2012 
competition -- Robot Rumble.

The code was written by Team 2976 (Skyline Spartabots)


## About the Game

## Overview
The goal of the game is to play basketball -- the robot will
collect balls from the one side of the field, move to the other
side, and score.  There are four baskets where you can try 
scoring -- one low, two medium, and one high.

In the middle of the field is a small metal barrier.  Robots can 
either attempt to cross over the metal barrier, or traverse
bridges that across the barrier.  The bridges can pivot above the 
metal barrier and must be pushed down in order to cross it.

The game comprises of 3 phases: hybrid, teloperated, and balancing.

### Hybrid
Robots will be working autonomously.  A single robot on each side
can be operated by a human via a Kinect.  Robots are able to
score during this phase.

### Teleoperated
Robots will be human-controlled (from the driving station) to 
attempt to score.

## Balancing
Robots will attempt to balance on the bridges across the metal
barrier.
