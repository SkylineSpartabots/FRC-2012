# Readme
## Introduction
This project contains the code needed to operate our robot for the 
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in 2011-2012 (Rebound Rumble) and 
was written by team 2976 (the Spartabots).

## Code
The code for this project can be found within the `/Code` directory.

The code is written in C++ and was developed and compiled using a
variant of WindRiver (which is actually a variant of Eclipse) specifically
tailored towards FRC teams. To obtain a copy of WindRiver, please
contact the current programming team lead.

We use [Subversion][1] for source control. There are plugins available
for Eclipse that let you use SVN from directly inside WindRiver. 

## Documentation
The detailed documentation -- including both a higher-level overview
and specific information about various classes and methods -- can be
found inside the `/Documentation` directory and was created using
Doxygen.

The documentation assumes that you are familiar with the details of
the 2011-2012 game. If not, we recommend you watch the following
[youtube video][2] which provides a complete overview of the game.

The documentation should be in the form of a series of HTML files and
can be viewed inside your web-browser.

Instructions for modifying the Doxygen output from within WindRiver can
be [found online][3].
