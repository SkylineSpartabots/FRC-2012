\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Contains base classes, typedefs for ports, and useful tools. \-In general, this file is meant to contain useful snippits of code meant to be used all over the program.\hypertarget{components_8h_aboutBaseClasses}{}\subsection{\-About Base Classes}\label{components_8h_aboutBaseClasses}
\-There are two base classes that all objects in this program should probably subclass -\/-\/ \hyperlink{class_base_component}{\-Base\-Component} and \hyperlink{class_base_controller}{\-Base\-Controller}. \-There are four tiers of objects used in this program\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-W\-P\-I\-Lib objects
\item \-Components
\item \-Controllers
\item \hyperlink{class_main_robot}{\-Main\-Robot}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-W\-P\-I\-Lib objects are ones provided by \-F\-I\-R\-S\-T -\/-\/ they interface directly with the hardware.

\-Components are classes we make that control specific pieces of the robot -\/-\/ the shooter and the elevator are examples of components.

\-Controllers are classes that take in user input and control both components and \-W\-P\-I\-Lib objects. \-They don't directly control any part of the robot, but is instead a thin layer that translates user input (for example, a joystick) and feeds that data into a component class.

\hyperlink{class_main_robot}{\-Main\-Robot} is a singleton class that bundles everything together.
