\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Operates device that shoots basketballs. \begin{DoxyWarning}{\-Warning}
\-The structure of this class is somewhat convoluted and intertwined. \-The way the code is arranged here is not optimal, and should not be emulated. \-However, we're not fixing or restructuring it because it works, and it would require too much testing to fix it. 
\end{DoxyWarning}
